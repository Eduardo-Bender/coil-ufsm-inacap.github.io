This is a gallery of software projects developed in the Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) between Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM), Brasil, and Instituto Nacional de Capacitaci√≥n Profesional de Chile (INACAP), Chile.

The site is built using Hugo and a portfolio template available in: https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme.git

## How to update your group's page?

1. Fork this project
2. Locate your group's folder inside the [2024/content/portfolio](2024/content/portfolio/) folder
3. Replace the two temporary images in your group's folder with two updated images:
   - an image that will serve as a thumbnail for your project in the gallery: this should show your project in use (possibly generated by uploading screenshots to https://mockuper.net/)
   - a larger image to appear in your project's page: this should be an animated gif or even an embedded video showing your project's features
4. Edit the index.md page in your group's folder:
   - replace image file names to point to the new images
   - fill in the missing links and information 
5. Commit the changes and open a pull request
   - Wait for the pull request to be manually merged (optional: for automatic merge, ask your advisor to add you to the GitHub organization)
