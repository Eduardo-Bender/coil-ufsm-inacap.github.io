## How to update your group's page?

1. Fork this repository
2. Locate your group's folder inside the [2024/content/portfolio](2024/content/portfolio/) folder
3. Replace the two placeholder images in your group's folder with updated visuals:
   - An image that will serve as a thumbnail for your project in the gallery. Ideally, this should showcase your project in a real-world scenario. You can take your own photos or create a mockup by uploading screenshots to https://mockuper.net/.
   - A larger visual for your project page. This should be an animated GIF or an embedded video that highlights your project's key features.
5. Edit the index.md page in your group's folder:
   - replace the placeholder image file names to point to the new images
   - fill in the missing links and information 
6. Commit the changes and open a pull request
   - Wait for the pull request to be **manually** merged (optional: for **automatic** merge, please ask your advisor to add you to the GitHub organization)
